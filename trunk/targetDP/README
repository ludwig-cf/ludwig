About
----------

targetDP (target Data Parallel) is a lightweight programming
abstraction layer, designed to allow the same application source code
to be able to target multiple architectures, e.g. NVIDIA GPUs and
multicore/manycore CPUs, in a performance portable manner.

See:

 Alan Gray and Kevin Stratford. “targetDP: an Abstraction of Lattice
 Based Parallelism with Portable Performance”. In: Proceedings of 2014
 IEEE International Conference on High Performance Computing and
 Communications (HPCC) (2014), pp. 312–315. doi:
 10.1109/HPCC.2014.212, http://arxiv.org/abs/1405.6162
